# Compliance Document Hub Blueprint

This repository contains a complete blueprint for building an AppSheet-powered
Compliance Document Hub that supports 35â€“40 departments and their assignees.
It includes:

* A relational data model designed for Google Sheets or a SQL backend.
* Step-by-step AppSheet configuration notes covering UX, security, and
  automations.
* Reporting and export workflows for dashboards, PDFs, and spreadsheets.
* Sample CSV data to jump-start sheet creation.

Use the documents in `docs/` together with the CSV templates in `data/` to set
up your own instance of the hub.
